<p>This page discusses the paper by <a href="http://sites.bu.edu/hyness/files/2016/02/coogan2015trafficltl.pdf">Coogan, et al</a> and also has some theoretical background for different queueing disciplines.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="queueing_disciplines">Queueing Disciplines</h3>
<p>There are many different disciplines for queueing. The FIFO (first-in-first-out) is the general standard. We also have several others worth discussing, and mathematical ways to represent them.</p>
<p>The notation described below is from <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/322003.322009">Chandy, et al</a>. The queueing disciplines I’ll list here are FIFO, LCFSPR (last-come-first-served preemptive resume), PS (processor sharing), IS (infinite server), preemptive fixed priority, and nonpreemptive fixed priority.</p>
<p>In particular, we will focus on expressing the queueing disciplines with two families of parameters: the arrival probabilities and the service rates.</p>
<p><em>Customer classes: There are <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> different classes of customers who use the queue, numbered <span class="math inline">\(k = 1,2,\ldots K\)</span>. Each class has an arrival rate <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{k}\)</span> according to a Poisson process, and a service distribution <span class="math inline">\(F_{k}\)</span>, which is general, though usually taken to be exponential.</em></p>
<p><em>States: Chandy et al view the queue as a set of stations, each of which is occupied by one customer. If there are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> customers in the queue, then the occupied stations are indexed by <span class="math inline">\(i=1,2,\ldots n\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(k(i)\)</span> is the class of the customer at station <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. The <strong>state</strong> of the queue is given by <span class="math inline">\(S = (k(1),\ldots,k(n))\)</span>and gives the occupancy of the queue. An example state is</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S = (3,2,1,1,2,2)\]</span> which shows that we have 6 customers in queue, the first of which is class 3, the second of class 2, etc.</p>
<p><em>Remark: The complete state of the queue needs to also account for the remaining service requirement of station <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, but we don’t need that stuff right now.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Queueing discipline: Here is where we describe the queueing disciplines. They are described using the conditional arrival probabilities <span class="math inline">\(a(i|S,k)\)</span> which describes the probability an arriving customer will enter station <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, given the current state <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and the customer’s class <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>; and the service rates <span class="math inline">\(r(i|S)\)</span>, which describes the service rate for the customer at station <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, given the occupancy state <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. The <strong>gross service rate</strong> <span class="math inline">\(R(S) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}r(i|S)\)</span>, and is typically 1.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We now characterize the above service disciplines and explain:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>FCFS: First-Come-First-Serve. We have that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a(i|S,k) = \delta_{i,n+1}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{i,n+1} = 1\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(i=n+1\)</span>, and 0 otherwise. This means that an arriving customer goes to the back of the line with probability 1 and nowhere else, regardless of class.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[r(i|S) = \delta_{i,1}\]</span> Here this means that the server is serving only the first customer in line.</p></li>
<li><p>LCFSPR: Last-Come-First-Serve-Preemptive-Resume</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a(i|S,k) = \delta_{i,1}\]</span> This time, the arriving customer is put at the top of the stack as soon as it arrives, regardless of class, and nowhere else.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[r(i|S) = \delta_{i,1}\]</span> As with FCFS, the first customer in the queue is served, and only this one.</p></li>
<li><p>PS: Processor Sharing</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a(i|S,k) = \frac{1}{n+1}\]</span> Here, the arriving customer (which makes a total of <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> customers) can go anywhere in slots <span class="math inline">\(i=1,\ldots n+1\)</span> with equal probaility.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[r(i|S) = \frac{1}{n}\]</span> Here, the server is shared equally among all current customers. The rate each customer gets is the <span class="math inline">\(1/n\)</span> fraction of the rate a lone customer would get.</p></li>
<li><p>IS: Infinite Server</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a(i|S,k) = \frac{1}{n+1}\]</span> Same as PS.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[r(i|S) = 1\]</span> Here, we assume that the server has the capacity to give its full attention to every single customer in the queue at the same time. Basically “perfect multitasking”. This is mostly a theoretical limit and not used in practice often.</p></li>
<li><p>PFP: Preemptive Fixed Priority</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a(i|S,k) = \delta_{i,1+\sum_{j=1}^{k}n_{j}}\]</span> Here we’ll have to expand. With fixed priority queueing disciplines, we have that all customers of class 1 come before all customers of class 2, etc. So an arriving customer goes to the back of the line for its class. <span class="math inline">\(n_{j}\)</span> denotes the number of customers of class <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> in the state <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(S = (1,1,2,3,3)\)</span>, and an arriving customer is of class 2, <span class="math inline">\(a(i|S,k)\)</span> is only 1 for <span class="math inline">\(i = 1+(2+1) = 4\)</span>, which puts it in the 4th position behind the current class 2 customer. Preemptive fixed priority states that a customer of class 1 can push down a current customer of a lower class, so if <span class="math inline">\(S = (2,2,3)\)</span>, and a customer of class 1 arrives, it will go to the head of the line and pre-empt the current customer who is class 2.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[r(i|s) = \delta_{i,1}\]</span> The server concentrates all its attention on the first customer in line.</p></li>
<li><p>NFP: Non-preemptive Fixed Priority This discipline is similar, but doesn’t “push down” a customer of a lower class.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a(i|S,k) = \delta_{i, 2+\sum_{j=1}^{k}n_{j}}\]</span> This shows us that if we have <span class="math inline">\(S = (2,2,3)\)</span>, and a customer of class 1 arrives, it will go in position <span class="math inline">\(2 + (0) = 2\)</span>, which is right behind the current class 2 customer, so the current head of the line isn’t pushed away.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[r(i|S) = \delta_{i,1}\]</span></p></li>
</ol>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="more_on_states">More on States</h3>
<p>This section details a bit more about the states of the queue.</p>
<div id="feasibility">

</div>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="feasibility">Feasibility</h4>
<p>We call a state <span class="math inline">\(S = (k(1),\ldots,k(n))\)</span> <strong>feasible</strong> if</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(S = \emptyset\)</span>, which corresponds to an empty queue, or</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(S = S&#39; + (i,k)\)</span>, where we obtain a new state from a feasible state by inserting a customer of class <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> in station <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, such that the arrival probability <span class="math inline">\(a(i|S&#39;,k) \neq 0\)</span>, and is thus governed by the queueing discipline. For <span class="math inline">\(S&#39; = (k&#39;(1),k&#39;(2),\ldots, k&#39;(n))\)</span>,<span class="math display">\[S = S&#39; + (i,k) = (k&#39;(1),k&#39;(2),\ldots,k&#39;(i-1),k,k&#39;(i+1),\ldots,k&#39;(n))\]</span> where we insert the new customer into slot <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, pushing the customer formerly in slot <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to slot <span class="math inline">\(i+1\)</span>, and so forth. The new length of the state is <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>. For example, for <span class="math inline">\(S&#39; = (2,3,3,1)\)</span> that is presumed feasible, and an arrival customer <span class="math inline">\((2,1)\)</span>, then</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S = S&#39; + (2,1) = (2,3,3,1) + (2,1) = (2,1,3,3,1)\]</span> where the arriving customer of class one is inserted into station 2, and is of class 1.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(S = S&#39;-i\)</span>, where we remove the customer at station <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> from a feasible state <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(r(i|S&#39;) &gt;0\)</span>. This is also governed by the queueing discipline.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll look at creating the set of feasible states with a few examples of queueing disciplines from before.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>FCFS: For FCFS, <span class="math inline">\(a(i|S,k) = \delta_{i,n+1}\)</span>. The first feasible state is <span class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span>. From there, we build <span class="math inline">\(S = (k(1))\)</span>, which is a single customer in the queue with class <span class="math inline">\(k(1)\)</span>. Following this, we can only add customers to the back of the line, regardless of the customer class. Thus, we can only get additional states of the form <span class="math inline">\(S&#39; + (i,k)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(i = n+1\)</span>. Via the subtraction/removal method, <span class="math inline">\(r(i|S) = \delta_{i,1}\)</span>, and thus we can only remove customers from the first slot. Thus <span class="math inline">\(S-1\)</span> are the only feasible “subtraction” states.</p></li>
<li><p>PS: For Processor sharing, <span class="math inline">\(a(i|S,k) = \frac{1}{n+1}\)</span>, meaning we are allowed to insert any customer of any class into any station <span class="math inline">\(i \in \{1,2,\ldots, n+1\}\)</span>, and it’s done with equal probability. <span class="math inline">\(r(i|S) = \frac{1}{n}\)</span>, so removal from any station <span class="math inline">\(i=1,\ldots,n\)</span> is feasible if there is a customer in that position to remove. Then from <span class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span>, we can build <span class="math inline">\(S = (k(1))\)</span>. From there, we may insert the next customer either in front of the first, or behind, or we may remove that customer. Similarly, for <span class="math inline">\(S = (k(1),\ldots,k(n))\)</span>, any <span class="math inline">\(S + (i,k)\)</span> is feasible for <span class="math inline">\(i=1,\ldots n+1\)</span>, and any <span class="math inline">\(S-i\)</span> is feasible for <span class="math inline">\(i=1,\ldots,n\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>PFP: Pre-emptive fixed priority has <span class="math inline">\(a(i|S,k) = \delta_{i,1+\sum_{j=1}^{k}n_{j}}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(r(i|S) = \delta_{i,1}\)</span>. Then the set of feasible states gets a little more complicated. From <span class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span>, we can build <span class="math inline">\(S = (k(1))\)</span>. After that, what is feasible depends on <span class="math inline">\(k(1)\)</span>. If the next arrival is a higher class, we must insert it ahead of the original customer. If the next arrival is the same class or lower, we must insert it behind the original. And like FCFS, we can only remove a customer from the head of the line, so only <span class="math inline">\(S-1\)</span> is feasible for feasible states <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We assign a probability of 0 to infeasible states and disregard them.</p>
<div id="complete_state_with_service_requirement">

</div>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="complete_state_with_service_requirement">Complete State (with Service Requirement)</h4>
<p>Regardless of situation, every customer comes with a service requirement that is random (sometimes called a service distribution). In the simplest case, the service requirement is given an exponential distribution for all customers, perhaps varying the rate with the class of customer. The exponential distribution is the most common one employed, because the distribution is memoryless, and we don’t need to keep track of the residual work remaining while a customer is in service.</p>
<p>However, there are many cases where we want to allow something besides the exponential distribution as a service requirement. Since the exponential distribution is the only continuous distribution with the memoryless property, changing the service requirement to anything else will require us to keep track of the residual work for each customer. There are many different ways to handle this, and this can be a topic of discussion if necessary.</p>
<p>Where this is relevant to the state of the queue is to note that the state <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> above only gives the discrete part, or occupancy, of the queue. We also need to tack on another vector that tracks each customer’s remaining service requirement. The <strong>complete state</strong> <span class="math inline">\(X = (S, X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})\)</span> takes the occupancy <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and appends <span class="math inline">\(X_{i}\)</span>, a variable giving the remaining service requirement. The service requirement is presume identical for each class of customers and is denoted <span class="math inline">\(F_{k}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(k=1,\ldots,K\)</span>. When a new customer of class <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is inserted at station <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(X_{i}\)</span> is chosen according to the distribution <span class="math inline">\(F_{k}\)</span>. As a customer is served, his residual service requirement decreases continuously to 0, at which point the customer departs. <span class="math inline">\(X_{i}\)</span> decreases according to the rate <span class="math inline">\(r(i|S)\)</span> determined by the service discipline, so <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d X_{i}}{dt} = -r(i|S)\)</span>.</p>
