<h2> Making Sense of Separation Axioms </h2>

<h4> R. Traylor </h4>

<em> This article presents the definitions of some of the main separation axioms in topology, with discussion, examples, and counterexamples. </em>

<h3> 1. Introduction </h3>

<p> We saw with the cofinite topology on certain sets that strange things can happen with sequences, and the reason that particular strange thing happened was because it wasn't a Hausdorff space. In a sense, we were able to make the sequence $(1,2,\ldots)$ converge to any integer we wanted to on the cofinite topology of integers because we couldn't "separate" the points enough to get unique limits. How "separate" do we need to make points? Sets? What does "separate" mean in a topological sense? Is it related to "separable"? This article will attempt to put some concreteness to the notion of separation in topological spaces. 

Firstly, the term <em>separable</em> in topology belongs in the hierarchy of countability rather than separability. Why choose the word separable and have it not mean "separability"? I don't know. I didn't make the rules. A topological space is <em>separable</em> if it contains a countable dense subset. That is, there needs to be a countable subset of the set $X$ whose closure is the whole space. The real numbers are separable, because the rational numbers are a subset of the reals which are countable, and every real number is the limit point of some rational number.\footnote{Think about rational approximations to irrational numbers, like decimal approximations of $\pi.$}. Second-countability is also called </em>completely separable</em>, but doesn't have anything to do with the separation axioms this article will investigate. Try to remember to distinguish "separability" from "separable" in topology, and get mad at the topologists who chose poor terminology.


</p>

<h3> 2. Separability Axioms </h3>

<p>

I'm going to follow the notation and definitions of <em>Counterexamples in Topology</em>, by Steen and Seebach. As a disclaimer, some of these definitions and axioms are not used the same in other literature, so the reader should take caution to clarify when reading other topological work.

Because we want some "nice" things, like uniqueness of limits, in our topological spaces, quite often we will design a topology requiring these properties from the outset instead of hoping we stumble on what we want. Thus, topologists can stipulate just how much we can "separate" distinct points in a set, or even sets themselves. I'll first lay out the axioms, then consider implications and exceptions. For all axioms, let $(X,\tau)$ be a topological space. 

</p>

<h4> 2.1 $T_{0}$ (Kolmogorov) space </h4>

<blockquote>
<b> Def. [$T_{0}$ (Kolmogorov) space].</b> If $a,b \in X$, then there is an open set $U \in \tau$ that contains either $a$, or $b$, but not both.
</blockquote>

<p> This one is the "ground level" separability. Being $T_{0}$ means that, given any two points in $X$, I can put an open set around one that excludes the other. In fact, this seems so basic that it should be true for any topology, right? Not exactly.
</p>

<p>The <em>double pointed countable complement topology</em> is an example of a topology that can't even satisfy this seemingly fundamental requirement. To construct this topology, first consider the <em>countable complement topology</em>, in which the open sets are all sets whose complements are countable.\footnote{One "step up" from the cofinite topology, which declared all sets with finite complements to be open.}. If $X = \mathbb{Z}$, then the set of even numbers is open, since its complement is the set of odd numbers, which is countable. Now, if we "double" the points by cloning them, we get the double pointed countable complement topology. The problem now becomes distinguishing, say, the number 9 from its clone, which is also a 9. This cannot be done. We can't draw any open set around 9 that won't contain its clone, so while the two 9 clones are "distinct" in a sense, we can't find any open set that can contain one clone but not the other.\footnote{Contrived example? Perhaps, but the point was to show that $T_{0}$ isn't a universal property of all topologies.}
</p>

<p>Another way to characterize the $T_{0}$ space is that no two points can be limit points of each other, which, as we mentioned earlier, seems like something that shouldn't be possible, and yet the double pointed countable complement topology shows us that it is. 
</p>

<p>Let us now consider an example of a $T_{0}$ space that will satisfy none of the other later axioms. Take a finite set $X$. To be specific, we'll take the numbers $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$. Fix a point $p$, perhaps $p=4$, but you can pick any point you like. We'll design a topology whose open sets are all the subsets you can make with $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ (including singletons), that include the point $p$. For $p=4$, we get that

$$\begin{align*}
\tau &= \left\{ \{4\}, \{1,4\}, \{2,4\}, \{3,4\}, \{4,5\}, \{1,2,4\}, \{1,3,4\}, \{1,4,5\}, \{2,3,4\}, \{2,4,5\}, \{3,4,5\},\right.\\
&\qquad \left.\{1,2,3,4\}, \{1,3,4,5\}, \{1,2,4,5\}, \{2,3,4,5\}, X, \emptyset \right\}
\end{align*}$$
</p>

<p>
This is called the <b>finite particular point topology</b>. We could have used any finite set of things, not just integers, although this is the easiest one to visualize quickly. 

To show this is $T_{0}$, Take any two points in $X$. One can (exhaustively) check to see that we can find at least one set in $\tau$ that contains one point but not the other. For example, if we take $2$ and $5$, then $\{2,4\}$ contains $2$ but not $5$. We can do this pairwise with all 5 points, and see that we can separate any two points by enclosing one in an open set such that the other is kept out. 

</p>

<h4> 2.2 $T_{1}$ space(Frechet topology) </h4>

<blockquote>
<b> Def. [$T_{1}$ space (Frechet topology)].</b> A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is $T_{1}$ if for all $a,b \in X$, there are open sets $U,V \in \tau$ such that $a \in U$, $b \in V$, and $a \not\in U, b \not\in V$. 
</blockquote>

<p>This time, we need to separate two points, as in $T_{0}$, but now using two open sets instead of just one. Comparing this with $T_{0}$, we see that $T_{1}$ implies $T_{0}$. If we can separate two points with two sets, then certainly we can do so with just one, so a $T_{1}$ space is also a $T_{0}$ space. 
</p>

<p>
An equivalent characterization of a $T_{1}$ space is that a topological space is $T_{1}$ if all singletons are closed sets. That is, no singletons can be in $\tau$, and all complements of singletons are in $\tau$. If we allowed a singleton to be open, as in the finite particular point topology, then we would be unable to separate that singleton from any other point in a way that satisfies the definition of $T_{1}$. For example, in the particular point topology, we let $p=4$, so $\{4\}$ was open. The definition of $T_{1}$ requires that we find two neighborhoods, one for each point, such that each point is in its own neighborhood and not the other one, even if the neighborhoods themselves overlap. If a singleton is open, this isn't possible, so it must be that all singleton sets are closed.\footnote{This is a far easier way to determine if a topological space is $T_{1}$ than the definition itself.} 
</p>

<p>An example of a $T_{1}$ space alone is the cofinite topology on a countable space. To see this, recall that the cofinite topology takes as its open sets all sets whose <em>complements}</em> are finite. Pick the integers $\mathbb{Z}$ as the countable set $X$ to make visualization easier. Then a set $V \in \tau$ contains all the integers except possibly a finite number of them. Thus, $X\setminus\{x\}$ is open, which means $\{x\}$ is closed by definition. Since all points are closed, the space is $T_{1}$. 
</p>

<h4> 2.3 $T_{2}$ (Hausdorff) space </h4>

<blockquote>
<b> Def. [$T_{2}$ (Hausdorff) space].</b> A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is $T_{2}$ if for any $a,b \in X$, there exist <em>disjoint</em> open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $a \in U$, $b \in V$. </blockquote>

<p>
We're still separating points, as in $T_{0}$ and $T_{1}$, and using two open sets, as in $T_{1}$, but this time we require the two open sets to be disjoint, having no points in common. 
Clearly, $T_{2}$ spaces are also $T_{1}$, since we basically kept the $T_{1}$ definition, but added an additional condition. Thus, we have the hierarchy that $T_{2} \Rightarrow T_{1} \Rightarrow T_{0}$.
</p>

<p>Hausdorff spaces have some nice properties and can be characterized in a few equivalent ways to the definition above: </p>

<ul>
<li> limits of sequences (or nets, if you prefer to generalize) are unique</li>
<li> any singleton can be written as the intersection of all closed neighborhoods of its point\footnote{A closed neighborhood is a closed set that contains an open neighborhood of $x$} </li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of Hausdorff spaces are quite plentiful. Every metric space is a Hausdorff space, which is why students of mathematical analysis don't typically encounter issues with non-uniqueness of limits. For a stranger example of a Hausdorff space that isn't any "stronger" than this level, we consider the <b>irrational slope topology.</b>
</p>

<p>
Let the set $X = \{(x,y): y \geq 0, x,y \in \mathbb{Q}\}$. Then we're looking at the lattice of 2D rational points, with the $y$ coordinate greater than 0 (the upper half plane). We'll generate the topology by creating a subbase. A <em>subbase</em> is a collection of subsets of $X$, and we generate a topology with this subbase by putting the sets of the subbase and any other subset of $X$ with can be made with the union (of any size) of finite intersections of stuff from the subbase, and throwing in $X$ and $\emptyset$ to round out the definition of a topology. 
</p>

<p>
Here, we'll make the subbase out of sets that are comprised of two intervals and a single point. Fix an irrational number $\theta$. Let $B_{\epsilon}(\eta) = \{r \in \mathbb{Q}: |r-\eta| < \epsilon\}$ be a normal ball centered at $\eta$ of radius epsilon. Then take $N_{\epsilon}((x,y)) = \{(x,y)\} \cup B_{\epsilon}(x+y/\theta) \cup B_{\epsilon}(x-y/\theta)\}$. Then each set in our subbase is some $N_{\epsilon}((x,y))$ that consists of the point $(x,y)$ and two intervals on the $x-$axis centered at $x \pm y/\theta$ comprised of rational points of length $2\epsilon$. Note that the center of each interval is an irrational number. 
<p>

<p>
Then the lines that join the centers of the intervals to the point $(x,y)$ have slope $\theta$, which is irrational. 
</p>

<p>
The sets in this topology are collections of rational ordered pairs in the upper half plane unioned with intervals of rational numbers on the $x-$ axis centered at irrational points according to the above description. 
</p>

<p>
To see why this topology on the rational numbers is Hausdorff, we'll verify the definition. The key is setting $\theta$ to be irrational. Because the slope of every line from the center of an interval to the point which generated it is irrational, no two points of $X$ can lie on a line with slop $\theta$. If one happens to land on a line of slope $\theta$, then no other point in $X$ can lie on the line of slope $-\theta$ which meets the original line at the $x$-axis. 
</p>
<p>
What we want is to show that, given any two distinct points in $X$, we can find disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that each open set contains only one of the two distinct points. The irrational slopes guarantee that any two points of $X$ project along the line of slopes $\pm \theta$ onto distinct pairs of irrational points on the $x$ axis, and we can certainly find disjoint neighborhoods of those by picking correct $\epsilon$'s for each point.
</p>

<h4> 2.4 $T_{3}$ spaces (regular Hausdorff) </h4>

Now we wish to "up" the game by separating entire sets from points. 

<blockquote>
<b> Def. [$T_{3}$ space].</b> A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is $T_{3}$ if for $A \subset X$ closed, $b \in X$ with $b \not\in A$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $A \subset U$, $b \in V$.
 </blockquote>

A $T_{3}$ space is able to separate any closed set from any point outside the closed set by enclosing each in open sets that are disjoint. An equivalent characterization is that each open set in the topology contains a closed neighborhood around each of the points in the set. 

If we thought we were building a hierarchy of implication, $T_{3}$ ruins it a bit. $T_{3}$ does not imply any of the previous separability axioms, nor do the other axioms imply $T_{3}$. In fact, all examples given thus far are examples of <em>only</em> their position in the hierarchy, so the irrational slope topology isn't $T_{3}$. 

For an example of a $T_{3}$ space (though it isn't <em>only</em>) $T_{3}$, let us take the post office metric. Take $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with the usual Euclidean metric $l_{2}$, so $d(x,y) = \sqrt{|x_{1}-y_{1}|^{2} + |x_{2}-y_{2}|^{2}}$. Now, define a new metric $d^{*}$ on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ by 
\[d^{*}(p,q) = \begin{cases} d(0,p) + d(0,q), & p \neq q \\
0, & p = q 
\end{cases}\]

To get a sense of the metric, suppose the post office marks the center of town, at 0. Then we measure the distance between two houses in the same way mail travels. A letter travels from one house's mailbox to the post office, then from the post office to the second house, not directly between the two houses. 

Then the topological space induced by this metric has as open sets all open balls $B_{\epsilon}(x) = \{y \in \mathbb{R}^{2} : d^{*}(x,y) < \epsilon\}$. Closed balls simply add the equality. Certainly then, for any closed set or closed ball, we can encase it in a slightly larger ball, separating it from a point not in the closed ball. 

Unfortunately, the hierarchical pattern stops here. A $T_{3}$ space need not necessarily be <em>any</em> 
of the other $T_{i}$ spaces, either below or above. An example of a $T_{3}$ only space requires more construction than I prefer to detail here, so to avoid distraction in the weeds, I'll omit the specifics of the Tychonoff corkscrew and leave only the comment that is it not common to be only $T_{3}$.

<h4> 2.5 $T_{4}$ spaces </h4>


<blockquote>
<b> Def. [$T_{4}$ space].</b> Let $(X,\tau)$ be a topological space. The space is $T_{4}$ if for any two disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $A \subset U$, $B \subset V$.
 </blockquote>

A $T_{4}$ space can fully separate two disjoint closed sets with disjoint open sets, rather than a closed set and a point. 

$T_{4}$ neither implies any other $T_{i}$ space nor is implied by any other $T_{i}$ space. For an example of a $T_{4}$ space that is only $T_{4}$, we turn to a modification of the double-pointed countable complement topology from earlier. We're going to create the <em>open extension</em> of this topology. 
Pick a new set $P$ that is disjoint from $X$. If we picked $\mathbb{Z}$ above for the double pointed countable complement topology, then perhaps we can pick the irrational numbers $P = \{\pi,e\}$\footnote{$P$ doesn't have to be finite or even countable, but we'll just take these two points to make it easy.}. Then the open extension creates a topology from $X \cup P$ (in our case, $\mathbb{Z} \cup P$) by declaring as open sets any set of the form $A \cup Q$, where $A$ is in $\tau$ and $Q \subseteq P$. So here, the open extension of the countable complement topology would have as open sets any subset of $P$ (including singletons) unioned with open sets from $\tau$ (sets whose complements are countable, and where we doubled all the points of the integers). 

This topology is only $T_{4}$, since one can prove that all open extension topologies are $T_{4}$, but as above, the double pointed countable complement topology satisfied neither $T_{0}$ nor $T_{1}$ (and thus not $T_{2}$), nor does it satisfy $T_{3}$ since no two open sets are disjoint. 

<h4> 2.5 $T_{5}$ spaces </h4>

We first need a definition of <em>separated sets</em>.

<blockquote>
<b> Def. [separated sets].</b> Two sets $A$ and $B$ are \textbf{separated} if $\bar{A} \cap B = A \cap \bar{B} = \emptyset$, where $\bar{\cdot}$ denotes the closure of a set. 
 </blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b> Def. [$T_{5}$ space].</b> Let $(X,\tau)$ be a topological space. The space is $T_{5}$ if for any two separated sets $A$ and $B$, there exist open sets $U,V \in \tau$ such that $U \cap V = \emptyset$, $A \subseteq U$, $B \subseteq V$. 
 </blockquote>

This one looks surprisingly similar to $T_{4}$, but here "disjoint" is replaced with "separated". To be separated means that the closure of each set is disjoint from the other set. In other words, it's possible that two open sets are disjoint, but if we close one, it could meet the other. Thus, we create the idea of separated to create a stronger condition. 

It should be reasonably clear that $T_{5}$ thus implies $T_{4}$. However, $T_{5}$ need not imply not be implied by any other axioms. $T_{5}$ commonly accompanies others, and the only example I could find of a $T_{5}$ only space is the nested interval topology, which is vacuously $T_{5}$ because no sets are separated.\footnote{Not cool. I hate vacuousity.} A familiar example that is $T_{5}$ and $T_{3}$ (also $T_{4}$) is the odd-even topology. Partition the positive integers into odds and evens with the partition $P = \{\{2k-1, 2K\}\}$ and generate a topology on this partition. A subset is open if and only if it is a union of elements of the partition, which means its complement is also open. Thus, open sets are also closed sets. Therefore, the closures of all open sets are just the sets themselves, and disjoint sets are also separable sets. So, this topology is $T_{3}$ and $T_{5}$ (and $T_{4}$ by implication.)

<h3> Special Combinations </h3>

<h4> Regular Spaces </h4>

<blockquote>
<b> Def. [regular space].</b> A topological space $(X, \tau)$ is \textbf{regular} if it is both $T_{3}$ and $T_{0}$.
 </blockquote>

Thus, a regular space can separate distinct points (though the sets used to separate them don't have to be disjoint), and separate any closed set from a point outside it with two disjoint open sets. I could find no example of a topological space that is \textit{only} regular and nothing else. Moreover, a regular space is necessarily Hausdorff.
